# gradle-skills

A [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) plugin providing skills for working with Gradle projects.

## Skills

### `upgrade-dependencies`

Guides Claude through checking, upgrading, and verifying Gradle dependencies one at a time, including **settings plugins** (those applied in the `plugins { }` block of `settings.gradle(.kts)`). Claude iterates through every available update automatically, committing each verified upgrade as its own atomic commit (one per dependency), and optionally pushes once all upgrades pass.

Updates come from the [Gradle Versions Plugin](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin)'s `dependencyUpdates` JSON report, run once per build, so **composite builds** (`includeBuild`) and `buildSrc` are covered. Where a build does not apply the plugin, Claude injects it with a temporary init script, leaving the build unmodified.

**Requires:** Gradle 8.4 or later. Optionally enriched by the [dependency-analysis-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-gradle-plugin) (for the `buildHealth` verification task).

**Works with:** any Gradle project, single or composite. Versions are upgraded where they are declared: a [version catalog](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html) (`libs.versions.toml`), a `settings.gradle(.kts)` `plugins { }` block, or a build script.

**Workflow:**
1. Settle the per-round and final verification tasks, and whether to push once everything passes (commits are automatic—one atomic commit per verified upgrade)
2. Enumerate the builds (root, every `includeBuild` target, and `buildSrc`) and run `dependencyUpdates` in each, through an init script where the build does not apply the plugin
3. Update one dependency or settings plugin at a time, where it is declared
4. Verify with the chosen tasks after each change (adding `--rerun-tasks` when a from-scratch check is warranted); when a major-version bump fails, retry once at the latest minor
5. Commit each verified change and continue automatically through every update; push only after a final verification passes, and only if you opted into push

**Sub-agents:** Each verification build runs in a sub-agent on a small, fast model that returns only a short summary. This keeps the raw Gradle output out of the main conversation, reducing context and plan (token) usage across a multi-round run.

### `upgrade-gradle`

Guides Claude through upgrading the Gradle wrapper to the latest available version.

**Requires:** nothing. The latest version comes from Gradle's own [version service](https://services.gradle.org/versions/current), so no plugin needs to be applied.

**Works with:** any Gradle project with a [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html), single or composite: every wrapper in the project is upgraded, each in its own build.

**Workflow:**
1. Query `services.gradle.org/versions/current` for the latest Gradle version
2. Find every `gradle-wrapper.properties` in the project (the wrapper task is per-build, so each is upgraded in its own directory)
3. For each: if that build's script has a `wrapper` task configuration, update the version there; otherwise pass it with `--gradle-version`, along with the distribution type and checksum where the build pins them. Either way, run `./gradlew wrapper` twice: the second run, on the new Gradle, regenerates `gradle-wrapper.jar` and the `gradlew` scripts
4. Run `build` to validate the upgrade (composite-aware: a root build may not reach every included build)

**Sub-agents:** Discovery and the validation build run in sub-agents that return a short summary, keeping verbose Gradle output out of the main conversation.

## Installation

Install at user scope (available across all your projects):

```
/plugin marketplace add IanBrandt/gradle-skills
/plugin install gradle-skills@ianbrandt
```

### Bash permissions (optional)

The dependency update workflow runs `./gradlew` tasks and `git` commands (it commits each verified upgrade automatically). To avoid per-invocation approval prompts, add these permissions in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(./gradlew dependencyUpdates:*)",
      "Bash(./gradlew build:*)",
      "Bash(./gradlew buildHealth:*)",
      "Bash(./gradlew wrapper:*)",
      "Bash(git add:*)",
      "Bash(git commit:*)",
      "Bash(git push:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

`git add` and `git commit` are used on every dependency run; `git push` is only needed if you opt into push. If you choose verification tasks beyond the defaults (e.g. a `clean` cumulative run), add matching `Bash(./gradlew …)` entries.

`upgrade-gradle` reads the latest Gradle version and its checksum from [services.gradle.org](https://services.gradle.org/versions/current) over HTTPS (via `curl` or a web fetch). Allow that mechanism if you want to avoid a prompt for it.
