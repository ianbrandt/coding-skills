# parallel-session-skills

A [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) plugin for a repo that several sessions are working at once.
Each session sits in its own git worktree and can see none of the others' context, so the sessions
coordinate only through git and a shared claim ledger. The skills here cover writing to that ledger
and running several lanes from one conductor session.

## Skills

### `claim-a-lane`

Write an atomic claim to the ledger before touching code. The paths the session expects to edit
are listed in the claim, so whether two tasks are disjoint is settled by comparing globs instead of
guessing from the task names. No issue tracker can supply that fact: two Jira issues that both edit
a dependency manifest look unrelated in Jira. The skill also covers the dead-claim reap: a claim is
dead when `git worktree list` shows no worktree on its branch. Merge state cannot be used for this,
since a just-claimed session's branch tip equals the default branch. And the etiquette: never `git
worktree remove` a sibling's directory, because a live session between tasks looks the same as an
abandoned one.

The rule that costs the most when it's missed: an empty ledger is not evidence the work is free. A
session releases its claim when the session ends, whether or not the work is finished, so after an
ordinary handoff the work is in flight with no claim.

### `conduct-a-pipeline`

One session conducting several lanes at once, unattended: hold 2–5 file-disjoint units of work in
flight, build each in its own worktree via a background Workflow, and process each as it finishes,
refilling until the candidates run out. Everything in it that looks paranoid is there because
nobody is watching. A Workflow's self-reported `ready` has been wrong on a red tree, so the
conductor runs the build gate itself and treats a report that fails it as a failure. A Workflow that
dies sends no completion notification, so a watchdog covers the pipeline that went quiet rather than
finished. After a second real failure the unit is flagged and the run continues without it, and a
flagged unit stays out of later refills so it isn't re-picked and re-burned every pass.

Candidates come from a backlog plugin, and each finished unit is recorded there.

## What it needs

`session-skills`, which provides the worktree these skills claim a lane in: `work-in-worktree`
locates the primary checkout, adopts the worktree work is already in flight on, and opens a fresh
one otherwise, and `land-and-wrap` gets the work back out. This plugin fills the lease seam defined
in `work-in-worktree` §0. The dependency runs one way: `session-skills` works alone and does not
refer to any plugin that fills its seams, but this plugin does not work without `session-skills`.
Nothing in the manifest format enforces that, so the check is in `claim-a-lane`, where the session
is told to stop and report when `work-in-worktree` is absent.

A backlog plugin is optional on top of both. It supplies what is workable and where something is
already in flight. Disjointness is still checked in the ledger, because an issue tracker has no
record of which paths a task edits.

## How it is wired

No `SessionStart` hook, and so no always-on token cost: nothing here applies to a session that never
opens a lane, and the skill descriptions are enough to trigger both skills.

One `SessionEnd` hook, which injects nothing into any session because it runs after the session is
over. It releases any claim that includes the ending session's id, so a session that dies or exits
without wrapping hands its lane back anyway. The hook is a safety net: `land-and-wrap` still
releases at wrap, which returns the lane immediately instead of whenever the session exits.
Restricted hooks (`disableAllHooks`, `allowManagedHooksOnly`, a managed policy, or an untrusted
workspace) disarm the net silently, which is why `claim-a-lane` has a step that checks for the
restrictions visible to the session and reports them. The self-check for `hooks/release-claim.sh`
is `release-claim.test.sh`; run it with `sh release-claim.test.sh`.

Editing any skill here is a plugin release: an installed session reads a version-keyed cache, so the
plugin's `version` in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` has to go up in the same commit, unless it
is already ahead of the version on `origin/main`. One bump covers every commit waiting to be pushed.
Without one, the session keeps serving the old copy.
