   step 2. A landed item is deleted from the roadmap, so the highest ID ever used is kept as one
   line in the roadmap's header, \`Highest ID used: R127\`. The next free ID is one more than the
   highest among that line, the roadmap, parked, and declined files, the open worktree directory
   names (\`r78-...\`), and the items in live claims. An item another lane wrote is committed only
   on that lane's branch, and an ID is never reused. Where the roadmap has no such line, also
   read, this one time, the headings of the items that were deleted:
   \`git -C "${main}" log -p --format= <default branch> -- ${roadmap} | grep -E '^-#+ R[0-9]+'\`

   it touches. In the same edit, raise the \`Highest ID used\` line to the new ID, adding the line
   to the header where there is none. The line only goes up, and a merge conflict on it is settled
   by taking the higher number. Commit the edit there.

   position: the problem in a sentence or two, and the paths it touches. A local-only roadmap is

   declined, and changelog files too, since an ID is never reused.

This repo's plan of record is \`${roadmap}\`, in the primary checkout at \`${main}\`.

A task the user states directly is handled like an item picked off the roadmap. Before the first
edit to a file that will be committed:

${steps}Land through \`land-and-wrap\` only. When a standing instruction authorizes merging to the
   default branch, \`land-and-wrap\` §1 is still where you find out whether this repo is a fork and
   whether its work lands as a pull request.

Size is no exemption: a one-line change that will be committed gets an item. A question answered
by reading gets none, and neither does an edit to the roadmap files themselves.

In a reply, write an item as its ID with a few words of its heading, "R12, the parser cache", and
never as a bare ID. The user is not reading the roadmap beside the conversation.`
