// House-style lint over prose, ported from an awk script function for function.
// lint(text) returns one line per flagged sentence:
//   <group>\t<matched text>
// With `note` it returns the note the next turn opens with instead, or '' when
// the text is clean. Pure: no files, no environment. Every line of the result
// ends in a newline.
//
// Five groups. Banned words and spaced em dashes are exact. A missing Oxford
// comma is caught only in a list of single words with two commas before the
// final "and" or "or" ("json, xml, html and plain"). A multi-word item, or a
// list with one comma ("a, b and c"), looks too much like a clause to flag.
// Inanimate agency is precision-first: a determiner-led or pronoun subject
// followed by a verb of speech, volition, cognition, or configuration (finite,
// or a participle such as "a file declaring an alias"), with the subject checked
// against an animate list, passives and adjectival participles excluded by the
// gap words, reduced passives ("the rule stated in", "three named endpoints")
// excluded by the word after the verb, and the noun-or-verb forms (names,
// states, claims, offers) kept only when an object-like word follows. Left out
// on purpose: holds, keeps, writes, uses, adds, sets, and "notes". A hand check
// of 90 hits found the first group mostly code mechanics (a map holds a value, a
// task writes a file, which rules.md allows as a program doing its job), and
// "notes" is nearly always the noun. The finite subject patterns are tried
// shortest first, so "the report says we decided" is caught on "the report says"
// before the longer span that includes the human clause is tried.
// The fifth group is a bulleted or numbered item that opens on bold text
// ("- **Label.** text"), matched on the raw line outside a fence.
//
// A pattern that can meet a character outside ASCII has the `u` flag, so that
// one outside the BMP is one character, as it is to awk in a UTF-8 locale. POSIX
// matching is leftmost-longest and JavaScript's is leftmost-first: in each
// pattern below, where two matches of different lengths can start at one place,
// the greedy order tries the longer one first.

// [[:alnum:]] as macOS awk reads it in a UTF-8 locale: ASCII and the Latin-1
// letters. In the C locale it is ASCII alone, and awk works in bytes there.
